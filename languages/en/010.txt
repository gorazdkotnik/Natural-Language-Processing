In a similar sense to fauna, and for similar reasons, the flora consists of fewer species compared to much larger continental Europe.[68] The flora comprises 3,354 vascular plant species, of which 2,297 are native and 1,057 have been introduced.[69] The island has a wide variety of trees, including native species of birch, beech, ash, hawthorn, elm, oak, yew, pine, cherry and apple.[70] Other trees have been naturalised, introduced especially from other parts of Europe (particularly Norway) and North America. Introduced trees include several varieties of pine, chestnut, maple, spruce, sycamore and fir, as well as cherry plum and pear trees.[70] The tallest species are the Douglas firs; two specimens have been recorded measuring 65 metres or 212 feet.[71] The Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is the oldest tree in Europe.[72]

There are at least 1,500 different species of wildflower.[73] Some 107 species are particularly rare or vulnerable and are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is illegal to uproot any wildflowers without the landowner's permission.[73][74] A vote in 2002 nominated various wildflowers to represent specific counties.[75] These include red poppies, bluebells, daisies, daffodils, rosemary, gorse, iris, ivy, mint, orchids, brambles, thistles, buttercups, primrose, thyme, tulips, violets, cowslip, heather and many more.[76][77][78][79]
There is also more than 1000 species of bryophyte including algae and mosses across the island. The currently known species include 767 mosses, 298 liverworts and 4 hornworts.[80]
